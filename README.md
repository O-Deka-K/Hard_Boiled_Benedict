# Hard Boiled Benedict TNH

"Give the guy a gun and he's Superman, give him two and he's God."

Based on John Woo's Hard Boiled. You are Inspector "Taquito", hard-boiled supercop single-handedly taking on the Hong Kong triads.

Designed for both Spawnlocking and Limited Ammo. IMO, they are completely different experiences. Try Endless mode too.

And watch out for Mad Dog!

## Features

- Starting equipment:
  - A revolver
  - A knife
  - A lighter
  - Your wits
- Sosigs can drop loaded guns (not just Sosigguns) and powerups.
  - Look for the infinite ammo powerup and go to town with guns akimbo!
- Bosses like in PMC Pete. They spawn only once per round.
- Since there are plenty of weapon drops, recyclers have been disabled. Run out of bullets? Pick a gun up from the ground and start blasting!
- Weapon panels have a chance for rare guns that you can't get from Sosig drops.
- There are several Sosig factions, so you'll often find them in firefights with each other.

Note: In the unlikely event that you haven't seen the movie (you like guns and you haven't watched Hard Boiled!?), the "cops" are actually Wong's henchmen.

## Bosses

Each round has its own boss based on characters from the movie:

- Round 1: Teahouse Gunman
- Round 2: Uncle Hoi
- Round 3: Alan
- Round 4: Mad Dog
- Round 5: Johnny Wong

Also, each boss has a special weapon that has a rare chance of dropping.
